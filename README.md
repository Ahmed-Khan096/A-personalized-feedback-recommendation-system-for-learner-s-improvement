The project aims to develop an advanced adaptive feedback system tailored for Learning Management Systems (LMS) using AI and machine learning techniques. This system addresses the shortcomings of existing LMS 
by focusing on personalized feedback that enhances learning outcomes. It proposes the use of K-Nearest Neighbors and Convolutional Neural Networks for dynamically adjusting question complexity, while employing 
Random Forests to provide adaptive feedback suggestions based on individual learner profiles and performance metrics. Deep learning algorithms will generate contextually informed insights to refine the feedback 
process. Future work includes ensuring data security through encryption, robust user authentication, and access controls, as well as leveraging natural language processing for generating contextually enriched 
explanatory feedback

KNN
The KNN model showed promising results in classifying students into the three prede-fined categories. The accuracy was high, indicating that the model effectively learned from the instances.
•	Accuracy: 95%
•	Precision: 95%
•	Recall: 95%
•	F-measure: 95%

The CNN was used for the authentication of our data set and results on it were quite good. The highest accuracy achieved was about 45%. The following graph shows test versus train-ing accuracy of our model.
